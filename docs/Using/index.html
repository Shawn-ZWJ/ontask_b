<p>The idea behind OnTask is to help instructors, learners and designers to exchange data  about what is happening in a learning experience to design and deploy personalized learner support actions. This last term, <em>personalized support actions</em> refers to any action that is offered to learners in different forms depending on personalized conditions. The typical <em>workflow</em> to use OnTask starts by uploading and combining available data about the learning experience, either extracted from some platform (LMS, video annotation, quizzes), provided by the learners (questionnaires), or captured by the instructors. The instructors then write simple rules to select a subset of students and create a resource (HTML page, a message, a visualization) so that its content depends on the data available for each learner. The following figure illustrates of this workflow:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/ontask_workflow.png"><img alt="../_images/ontask_workflow.png" src="../_images/ontask_workflow.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Imagine a learning experience in which you want to provide three personalized messages to the learners. In the first week, you want to send a welcome email and personalize slightly the text of this message based on the student background (courses taken before this one). The second week you want to send some comments and suggestions about the participation in the forum and the text will depend on the measures of engagement obtained from the platform. The third personalized email will vary depending on the level of engagement with the videos in the course. The idea of these messages is that you want to change the text in the message for each learner based on the information stored in the table.</p>
<p>OnTasks allows instructors to manage a set of <strong>workflows</strong>. A <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow"><span class="std std-ref">workflow</span></a> contains a <strong>table</strong> with data about the learners and a set of <strong>actions</strong>. After creating and opening a workflow you need to populate the table with data extracted from the learning environment. We assume that there several data sources (coming from the use of technology, self-reported by the students, or observed and reported by the instructors). These data sources are combined and stored in the <strong>table</strong>. Think of the table as a conventional excel sheet storing the information about the learners (one learner per row and a set of features about each learner as columns).</p>
<p>The other relevant entity in OnTask is the <strong>action</strong> that is either a set of questions to collect information from the learner or a text with elements that are selected or ignored based on <strong>conditions</strong> that are evaluated with respect to the learner student features stored in the table. This text can be included in an email, made available through a web page, or forwarded to another system for further processing.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>This section describes the operations to either upload the first set of data into the table, or merge additional data with the one already stored. This step may be done automatically before you work with a workflow. If this is the case, you may skip this section or revisit it when you need to manipulate the existing data.</p>
<p>The data operations are divided into the following categories:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Upload</dt><dd><p>Load the first data set in an empty table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Merge</dt><dd><p>Combine the existing data with new data</p>

</dd>
<dt>Run a model</dt><dd><p>Use the existing data to <strong>predict</strong> additional values.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These operations are available after selecting a workflow for manipulation under the top menu option <strong>Table</strong>.</p>
<p>If the workflow table is empty, OnTask will request the parameters required to <a class="reference internal" href="#upload-data"><span class="std std-ref">upload data</span></a> from a given data source. On the other hand, if the workflow table already contains data, OnTask will request the parameters to perform a <em>merge operation</em> in which the existing data is combined with the data extracted from the given source.</p>

<h4>3.2.1.1. Upload CSV Files<a class="headerlink" href="#upload-csv-files" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>CSV or âcomma separated valueâ files are plain text files in which the first line contains a comma-separated list of column names, and every subsequent line contains the values of these columns for each row. It is a popular format to exchange data that can be represented as a table (Microsoft Excel allows to save one sheet in a spreadsheet file into this format). The following figure shows the first step to perform this operation.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_csvupload.png" src="../_images/dataops_csvupload.png" />
</div>
<p>In some cases, the file with comma-separated values contains several lines at either the top or the bottom of that need to be skipped when processing the data. The page to upload the CSV file allows you to specify the number of lines to skip at the start and end of the file.</p>

<h4>3.2.1.6. Confirmation step to upload data<a class="headerlink" href="#confirmation-step-to-upload-data" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>When uploading data for the first time, the values are prepared to be assigned as the initial content of the workflow table. But before this assignment is done, the platform needs you to verify some information. Upon reading the new data, OnTask will automatically detect the data type in each column and those columns that have unique values (no repetitions) and mark them as <strong>keys</strong>. Key columns are very important because their values (as they are different for every row) are required for several operations. The workflow table <strong>must have at least one key column</strong>. If here are several columns with this property, OnTask <a class="reference internal" href="#details"><span class="std std-ref">allows you to *unmark* some of them as non-key</span></a> as long as there is always one of them wih such mark. Additionally, you may <a class="reference internal" href="#details"><span class="std std-ref">mark any column as a key column</span></a> if the values are all different. The operations to manipulate column information is described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#details"><span class="std std-ref">Workflow Operations</span></a>.</p>
<p>Before finishing the upload step and storing the data in the table, OnTask also allows you to change the name of the columns or change the <strong>Key</strong> attribute as shown in the following figure.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_upload_merge_step2.png" src="../_images/dataops_upload_merge_step2.png" />

<span id="id3"></span><h3>3.2.2. Data Merge<a class="headerlink" href="#data-merge" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Merge a.k.a âJoinâ</p>
<p>Merging is a common operation in databases and is commonly known as <em>join</em>. There are several variants of join operations depending how the differences between the key columns are handled. These same variants exist in OnTask when combining the data already existing in the table. The operation relies on the <strong>key column</strong> to merge the two sources.</p>
</div>
<p>A merge operation is executed when data is uploading and the workflow <strong>already has data in its table</strong>. Although this operation is common in data science contexts, it has several variants that make it challenging to use properly. These variants derive mostly from the method used to specify how the values in the new columns are <em>matched</em> with respect to the ones already existing in the table. In other words, each new column has a set of values, but they need to be in the right order so that the information is matched appropriately for every row. For example, if the table contains a column with the age of the learners, and a new column with the gender is merged, the rows of the new column need to correspond with the learners in the existing table. The way to address this issue is to use a <strong>key column* in the existing table and another ** key column</strong> in the new data. These columns uniquely distinguish each row with a value so they are used to make sure that the information for the rows with matching values in these columns are merged. These operations are executed in a set of additional steps. The first step of the merge operation is identical to the upload operation. After detecting the column data types, the key columns and offering the option of changing their names, the next steps identify the key columns to use in the merge, the variant to merge, and shows a summary of the changes that will result from the operation.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Merge method</dt><dd><p>After choosing a merge method, a figure and explanation are shown below.</p>

<p>There are four possible merge variants:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Select only the rows with keys in both existing and new table</strong>.
It will select only the rows for which values in both key columns are present. Or in other words, any row for which there is no value in either of the key columns <strong>will be dropped</strong>.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Select all rows in either the existing or new table</strong>.</p>
<p>All rows in both tables will be considered. You have to be careful with this option because it may produce columns that are no longer unique as a result.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/merge_outer1.png"><img alt="../_images/merge_outer1.png" src="../_images/merge_outer1.png" style="width: 50%;" /></a>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Select the rows with keys in the existing table</strong>.</p>
<p>Only the rows in the new table with a value in the key column that is present in the existing table will be considered, the rest will be dropped.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Select the rows with keys in the new table</strong>.</p>
<p>Only the rows in the existing table with a value in the key column that is present in the key column from the new table will be considered, the rest will be dropped.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>In any of these variants, for those columns that are present in both the existing table and the new table, the values of the second will update the existing ones in the first. This update may introduce non-values in some of the rows (for example in columns for with the new data does not provide any value). Additionally, extra care needs to be taken when performing this operation as some of the merge variants may eliminate data in the existing table. In the extreme case, if you try to merge a table with a key column with no values in common with the existing key and you select the method that considers rows with keys in both the existing and new table, the result is an empty table.</p>

<p>Due to the potentially large size of the workflow table in either number of rows or columns, OnTask offers the possibility to define <em>Views</em>. A view is a subset of columns and rows of the original table. You may define as many views as needed. The link <em>Views</em> in the main table page shows the views available and the operations to manage them.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/table_views.png"><img alt="../_images/table_views.png" src="../_images/table_views.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>

</dd>
<dt><span class="fa fa-plus"></span> View</dt><dd><p>Create a new view</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When creating a view you need to provide a name (required), a description, a subset of columns to show (at least one of them must be a <strong>key column</strong>), and an expression to select a subset of rows. This expression is evaluated with the values of every row and if the result is <em>True</em>, the row is included in the view. The following figure shows an example of the information that is included in the definition of a view.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p>Once a view is created, the following operations are available:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Edit</dt><dd><p>Click in the view name to edit its elements (name, description, set of columns to show and row filter)</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The page to show the subset of the table defined by the view is identical to the full table view, but the table is restricted to the appropriate columns and rows. The view shown in the previous figure defines a subset of 12 columns of the table that is rendered as shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>These actions allow to create a document (similar to a HTML page) and mark elements (paragraphs, sentences, images) with <em>conditions</em> that will control if they are included or ignored when showing the document. The conditions are stated in terms of the columns of the data table. Think of this personalized content as a resource (message, tip, comment) you would offer learners but with content that is different depending on the data stored in the table. You may have several of these actions prepared to be used at different points during a learning experience. The personalized text action is manipulated with the screen shown in the following figure:</p>

<p>The screen has three tabs: the left one contains the editor, the center one the definition of a filter (optional) to select a subset of the learners to consider for this action, and the right tab contains the conditions used in the text (if any).</p>
<dl id="personalized-text-editor">

<dl id="personalized-text-filter">
<dt>The filter</dt><dd><p>The center tab shows a <em>filter</em>. This element is an expression used to decide which learners (or more precisely, the corresponding rows in the data table that) will be selected and used in this action.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_action_out_filterpart.png"><img alt="../_images/action_action_out_filterpart.png" src="../_images/action_action_out_filterpart.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>

</dd>
<dt><span class="fa fa-trash"></span> Delete</dt><dd><p>Remove the filter from the action.</p>

<p>When editing or creating a filter, the form shows the information as in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_action_out_edit_filter.png"><img alt="../_images/action_action_out_edit_filter.png" src="../_images/action_action_out_edit_filter.png" style="width: 60%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The expression in this condition is shown under the title <strong>The learner will be selected if</strong> and can be read as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Video_1_W4 = 0 or Video_2_W4 = 0</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The first element of the expression is the sub-expression <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code> which contains the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span></code>, the equal sign, and the constant zero. The second element is a sub-expression with the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_2_W4</span></code>, the equal sign, and the constant 0. These two sub-expressions are connected through the <strong>OR</strong> operator, which means that the expression will be <strong>True</strong> if either of the sub-expressions are <strong>True</strong>, and <strong>False</strong> in any other case. When evaluating this expression, the variables are replaced by concrete values (numbers). For example, if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span></code> is replaced by 3, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_2_W4</span></code> is replaced by 4, the evaluation will transform the expression into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 = 0 or 4 = 0\)</span>. The sub-expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 = 0\)</span> is clearly <strong>False</strong> and so is the other sub-expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4 = 0\)</span>. This means the initial expression is <strong>False</strong>. result is either <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>. Another possible evaluation is if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span></code> is equal to zero (and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_2_W4</span></code> remains equal to 4). In this case the resulting expression is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 = 0 or 4 = 0\)</span>. In this case, the first sub-expression is <strong>True</strong>, and although the second is <strong>False</strong>, only one is needed for the overall expression to be <strong>True</strong>.</p>
<p>These conditions can have nested sub-expressions and get complex fairly quickly. However, the underlying mechanism to evaluate them remains the same: replace variables with values and decide the result (<strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="personalized-text-conditions">
<dt>Text conditions</dt><dd><p>The right tab contains the <em>text conditions</em>. A condition is an expression that when evaluated with respect to the values in the table for each learner will either be <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.

The button <span class="fa fa-bar-chart"></span> <em>Column statistics</em> allows to select a column and show a statistical summary of its values.</p>
<p>Each condition shows the number of learners for which the expression in that condition evaluates to <strong>True</strong> (if this value is zero, it means that any text you include in the editor controlled by this condition will not appear for any of the learners), the name, description, and the defined formula.</p>
<p>The icons in the bottom of the condition element allow the following operations:</p>

<p>The first element is the column name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Correct_1_W4</span></code>, followed by the equal sign, and then the constant zero. When evaluating this expression, the column name is replaced by the value from the corresponding to each learner. For example, if a given learner has <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Correct_1_W4</span></code> equal to 3 the evaluation will transform the expression into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 = 0\)</span> which is <strong>False</strong>. Another possible evaluation is if another learner has <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Correct_1_W4</span></code> equal to zero. After substitution of the column by the values for the learner, the resulting expression is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 = 0\)</span>. In this case, the expression is <strong>True</strong>. Once defined this condition can be applied to a part of the personalized text. When creating the texts, the condition is evaluated with the values for each student. If the expression is true, the text is included, if not, it is ignored. This mechanism is at the heart of how OnTask personalizes the content of the actions. In the example above, the expression in the condition one of the learners in the data table.</p>

<p>As previously described the <a class="reference internal" href="#personalized-text-editor"><span class="std std-ref">Personalized Text Editor</span></a> may include three per-learner personalized elements: an attribute name, a column name or a portion of text marked with a condition.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Attributes</dt><dd><p>Attributes are simply synonyms that you may want to use in more than one action. For example, if you have several actions that include the name of a course, instead of including that name if all actions, you may define an <em>attribute</em> with name <em>course name</em> and value <em>Biology 101</em> and include in the actions the attribute name. OnTask will replace that attribute with its value when showing the text to the learners. If you then change the name of the course (or you export this workflow and import it to be used in another course), you only need to change the attribute and the name of the course will appear correctly in all actions (in what is called a <em>single point of change</em>).</p>
<p>To insert an attribute name in the text simply place the cursor in the editor where you want the value of that attribute to appear and select the attribute from the area above the editor. The name of the attribute will be inserted in the text surrounded by double curly braces, (for example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">course_name</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. Only <a class="reference internal" href="#details-attributes"><span class="std std-ref">the attributes</span></a> you previously created in the details page are available.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Column names</dt><dd><p>The other element that can be personalized is a column name. For example, suppose you have a column in your table with the first name of the learners. You can use the column name to personalize the greeting in the text. To insert a column name, you follow the same steps used for the attribute but this time you select the column name from the pull-down menu. You will see that the name of the column appears in the text also surrounded by double curly braces (for example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hi</span> <span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">GivenName</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. The double curly
braces is the way OnTask has to mark that text to be personalized or replaced by the corresponding value for each learner extracted from the data table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Conditional text</dt><dd><p>Using a condition to control if a portion of the text is shown or ignored is slightly different. You need to first highlight the text you want to appear depending on the condition in the editor. Then click in the pull down menu <strong>Use condition in highlighted text</strong> and select the condition to use. The text will be surrounded by two marks. For example if the condition name is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">No</span> <span class="pre">Video</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>, the text you highlighted will appear in the editor after clicking in the <em>Insert in text</em> as:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">Video</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">need</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">review</span> <span class="n">his</span> <span class="n">week</span><span class="s1">&#39;s video{</span><span class="si">% e</span><span class="s1">ndif %}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This format marks the message <em>You need to review this weekâs video</em> to appear only for those learners for which the condition <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">No</span> <span class="pre">Video</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> evaluates to <strong>True</strong> with their current values in the data table. Otherwise, the text will be ignored. The following figure illustrates this process.</p>

<span id="personalized-rubric"></span><h3>3.4.2. Personalized Rubric Feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#personalized-rubric-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>These actions are a special case of the <a class="reference internal" href="#personalized-content"><span class="std std-ref">personalized text</span></a> where an email template is combined with a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)">rubric</a> to provide learners with a set of comments based on the obtained scores. A rubric is a two dimensional table. Each row is a <em>criterion</em> used for assessment (for example, when using a rubric to grade a presentation, one criterion could be the clarith with which concepts have been presented. The columns of the table are <em>levels of attainment</em> that specify how well was the criterion addressed. In each cell of this two-dimensional table there is a paragraph describing the elements of the corresponding criterion and level of attainment.</p>
<p>OnTask extends the structure of each cell and complements the description with an additional text that is called the <em>feedback</em>. Once the table has been populated (multiple criteria and multiple levels of attainment), an email template can be created in which the appropriate feedback elements are selected based on the values of each criteria for each learner.</p>
<p>The first step to create a personalized rubric feedback action is, as with the previous action, to click in he button to add an action and select the option <em>Rubric feedback</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/rubric_create.png"><img alt="../_images/rubric_create.png" src="../_images/rubric_create.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The personalized rubric feedback action is created and modified using the screen shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/rubric_edit_text.png"><img alt="../_images/rubric_edit_text.png" src="../_images/rubric_edit_text.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Three tabs are available in this screen. From left to right, the first one is the ref:<cite>personalized text editor &lt;personalizez_text_editor&gt;</cite>. It offers the same functionality as described for the <cite>personalized text action &lt;personalized_content&gt;</cite> with the difference that the only personalized content allowed is the comments extracted from the rubric. Place the cursor in the location in the email and click the buttom <em>Insert rubric text</em> to insert the mark that will be replaced by the rubric text.</p>
<p>The second tab is identical to the one in the ref:<cite>personalized text action &lt;personalized_content&gt;</cite> to select a subset of learners to consider for this action. The right-most tab is where the rubric table is manipulated. The criteria in the rubric are either already existing columns with a common set of pre-defined values, or you can create the criteria specifying these values. The following figure shows an example of rubric with two criteria (<em>Presentation</em> and <em>Structure</em>) and each of them with three levels of attainment (<em>High</em>, <em>Medium</em> and <em>Poor</em>).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/rubric_edit_table_tab.png"><img alt="../_images/rubric_edit_table_tab.png" src="../_images/rubric_edit_table_tab.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>As it can be seen in the figure, each criterion (row) has a left-most cell explaining what is considered, and then three additional cells (one per level of attainment) with the description of what is expected for that level, and the text to be provided as feedback. The buttons at the top of the rubric allow you to create new criteria (or columns within your workflow) or to edit the text used for the level of attainment.</p>
<p>The <em>Preview</em> button at the top of the page allows you to see the different messages generated when the rubric is evaluated based on the values of the criteria for each student. This is the text as it will be included in an email message, or made available through an URL.</p>
<p>Once you have <em>selected</em> a set of columns as criteria in the rubric with identical pre-defined values, these should not change, otherwise, the content of rubric becomes inconsistent and cannot be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="surveys">
<span id="id6"></span><h3>3.4.3. Surveys<a class="headerlink" href="#surveys" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The personalized text actions described in the previous section make information available to the learners. The <em>survey</em> actions perform the operation in the opposite direction, they collect information from the learners and store it in the table. In a learning context a survey can be used by the learners to submit certain data, or by the instructor to collect annotations about learners throughout the experience. OnTask supports these two modalities. Survey actions are edited with a page with four tabs as shown in the following figure.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_edit_action_in.png"><img alt="../_images/action_edit_action_in.png" src="../_images/action_edit_action_in.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The information collected for each question will be represented in the table by a column. The editor page allows you to use any of the existing questions to be included in a survey. The three tabs in the screen offer the following functionality.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Survey parameters</dt><dd><p>This tab shows the additional parameters to deploy the survey. More precisely the screen allows to define the text that is shown at the top of the survey (<em>Survey description</em>), the key column used to identify the users, and if the questions should be shown in different order for each user.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_edit_action_in_parameters.png"><img alt="../_images/action_edit_action_in_parameters.png" src="../_images/action_edit_action_in_parameters.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Survey Questions</dt><dd><p>This tab shows the questions that are contained in the survey. The two buttons at the top of the screen allow you to either insert an existing question (the pull-down menu will show all the column names available in the table) or create a new question. When creating a new question, the following form is used:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_edit_action_in_create_question.png"><img alt="../_images/action_edit_action_in_create_question.png" src="../_images/action_edit_action_in_create_question.png" style="width: 60%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The field <em>Question name</em> will be used internally as the column name in the table. The <em>Description</em> field is the text shown to the learners next to the question. If the question includes a set of values allowed, the form available to the students will collect the answers using a pull-down menu with the given choices.</p>
<p>Once a question has been defined, its inclusion in the survey can be controlled using a condition defined in the <em>Conditions</em> tab. The pull down menu to the right of the question description allows to select the condition.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/action_edit_action_in_question_tab.png" src="../_images/action_edit_action_in_question_tab.png" />
</div>
<p>As with other tables in OnTask, if the number of elements (in this case questions) is too large, they will be divided into pages with a link to access each page, and the content of the questions is searchable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Select Learners</dt><dd><p>This tab is identical to <a class="reference internal" href="#personalized-text-filter"><span class="std std-ref">the filter in the personalized text action</span></a>. The tab allows to include an expression to decide if a learner is included or not in the survey. This survey has no filter defined.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Conditions</dt><dd><p>This tab allows the definition of conditions identical to <a class="reference internal" href="#personalized-text-conditions"><span class="std std-ref">the text condition tab</span></a> in the personalized text actions. The conditions can then be attached to the questions to decide if they are present or not in the survey.</p>

The difference is that instead of creating a text, the action creates a JSON object that will eventually be sent to another platform for further processing.

<p>In order for the learners to be able to view their personalized content, they have to be users of the OnTask platform and their ID present in the data table. This functionality is conceived for a context in which OnTask authenticates users either through a corporate Single-sign on layer, or learners access the OnTask through the Learning Management System with a LTI interface (see <a class="reference internal" href="../Install/index.html#authentication"><span class="std std-ref">Authentication</span></a>).</p>

<p>After creating a <a class="reference internal" href="#surveys"><span class="std std-ref">survey action</span></a> it can be used in two modalities: run by the instructor, or given to the learners to fill out the data. The first modality is used as a mechanism to capture instructor observations. For example, surveys run by the instructor can be used as an attendance capturing mechanism (if the instructor has a device or procedure to capture who is in attendance).

<p>The second operation available for <em>survey</em> actions is to make available the URL to learners so that they individually enter the information themselves. The right-most column of the action table contains an icon with three dots that if selected shows a set of additional operations, and one of them has the text <em>URL</em>. If selected OnTask shows the URL for the survey, the possibility of enable/disable it, or even provide a date/time window for its availability.</p>

<p>Once enabled, you may send the URL to the students (you may even use a personalized text action for that). Once the students click in the action, and if they are allowed to connect to OnTask as basic users, after authentication, if their email is part of the table, they will see a form with the survey questions and after answering it, the values are automatically stored in the right row and column in the table.</p>
<p>These two survey actions are ideal to collect information about any aspect of a learning experience in a way that is centralized and available for further processing through personalized text actions. For example, users may choose from a predefined set of topics those that were more challenging. This information can then be used in a personalized text action to provide the adequate resources to each learner.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#personalized-content"><span class="std std-ref">personalized text actions</span></a> offer the possibility of creating a ZIP file containing one HTML file with the personalized text for every learner. The execution of this operation requires the use of two columns in the table and a suffix to create the file names.

The additional information is requested through the form shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>In addition to the buttons at the top, the <em>Workflow Operations</em> page offers two additional operations shown in separated tabs.</p>
<dl id="details-attributes">

</div>
<p>The <span class="fa fa-plus"></span> <em>Attribute</em> button opens a form to introduce the name and value of a new attribute. The table below this button shows the attributes available for the workflow. The name of the attribute is a link that opens the form to edit its content. The <span class="fa fa-trash"></span> icon on the right deletes the attribute.</p>
<p>The use of these attributes is to facilitate a single point of change when a value appears in multiple locations. For example, every personalized text actino is singed with the name of the instructor. If that name changes, all actions need to be edited. On the other hand, if the actions contain the name of an attribute, just changing the attribute value propagates the change to all actions.</p>

<p>The platform keeps a log of most of the operations that are executed when managing a workflow. These records are available through the <em>View Logs</em> link in the <span class="fa fa-cog"></span> <em>More</em> pull down menu at the top-bar menu. The page shows information about the records in tabular form. The following figure shows an example.</p>

</div>
<p>The <span class="fa fa-download"></span> <em>CSV Download</em> button allows to download the logs in CSV format for further processing. Additionally, the content of the table is paginated and the links to access each page are shown at the botton. The records can be searched using the box at the top right corner of the table.</p>

<span id="plugin-run"></span><h2>3.8. Transforming the data with your own code<a class="headerlink" href="#transforming-the-data-with-your-own-code" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The additional method offered by OnTask to manipulate the data in a workflow table is to execute arbitrary Python code encapsulated as a Python module and placed in a predefined folder in the computer hosting the server. These Python modules are called either <strong>Transformations</strong> or <strong>Models</strong> and require some <a class="reference internal" href="../Install/index.html#plugin-install"><span class="std std-ref">previous configuration</span></a> by the system administrator, namely, the Python module must be installed in a specific folder.</p>
<p>The purpose of these transformations and models is to allow arbitrary processing of the data attached to a workflow such as machine learning algorithms, predictive models, etc. The list of transformations available for execution can be accessed through the links <em>Run Transformation</em> and <em>Run Model</em> in the <em>Table</em> button of the top menu. The modules available for execution are shown in a table like the one in the next figure.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/dataops_transform_list.png"><img alt="../_images/dataops_transform_list.png" src="../_images/dataops_transform_list.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Each transformation is shown with a name, a description and the last time the code was modified (based on the file modification time). The link in the name opens a form to introduce the information required for execution. The following figure shows and example of this page.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/dataops_transformation_run.png"><img alt="../_images/dataops_transformation_run.png" src="../_images/dataops_transformation_run.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The information requested in this page is divided into the following tabs.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Input columns to transformation</dt><dd><p>This field is to select the subset of columns from the data table that will be passed when invoking the transformation. It is possible for a transformation to define a set of <em>fixed</em> column names as inputs. If this is the case, the field in this tab shows those names and does not allow changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Columns to store the result</dt><dd><p>The middle tab in this page includes fields to obtain the output column names (the transformation may supply suggestions, an optional suffix to add to the result column names to be able to differentiate between multiple executions of the transformation, and a key column to be use when merging the result of the transformation with the current table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Parameters</dt><dd><p>This tab contains a form to pairs <em>(name, value)</em> as defined by the transformation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt><dd><p>Text describing in detail the effect of the transformation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once the data is filled, the program is executed by clicking in the <span class="fa fa-rocket"></span> <em>Run</em> button. The execution is done in the background (it may take some tie), and a link to the log including the report is shown.</p>
<div class="section" id="transformation-requirements">
<span id="plugin-requirements"></span><h3>3.8.1. Transformation requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#transformation-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The information in this section is for those users that want to write a Python module. The modules installed in the predefined folder need to satisfy several requirements to be considered for execution within OnTask. More precisely, each module must be stored in its own folder (as a Python module). The file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></code> in the module must contain:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Module variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">class_name</span></code> with the name of the class in the file that contains the required definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>The definition of a class with the name stored in the previous variable. The class must inherit either from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dataops.plugins.OnTaskTransformation</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dataops.plugins.OnTaskModel</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span></code> with the transformation name to show to the users.</p></li>
<li><p>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">description_txt</span></code> with a string with the detailed description of what the transformation does</p></li>
<li><p>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_column_names</span></code> with a potentially empty list of column names (strings). If the list is empty, the columns are selected by the user at execution time.</p></li>
<li><p>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">output_column_names</span></code> with a potentially empty list of names (strings) of the columns to be used for the output of the transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">parameters</span></code> with an optionally empty list with tuples with the following structure:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">('name',</span> <span class="pre">type,</span> <span class="pre">[list</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">allowed</span> <span class="pre">values],</span> <span class="pre">initial</span> <span class="pre">value,</span> <span class="pre">help_text)</span></code></p>
<p>These elements will be requested from the user before executing the transformatino through a form. The conditions on these values are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>name must be a string</p></li>
<li><p>type must be a string equal to âintegerâ, âdoubleâ, âstringâ,
âdatetimeâ or âbooleanâ.</p></li>
<li><p>The list of values is to restrict the
possible values</p></li>
<li><p>The initial value must be of the type specified by the second
element.</p></li>
<li><p>Help_text a string to show as help text</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Class method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run</span></code> that receives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a pandas data frame with the data to process</p></li>
<li><p>a string with the name of the key column that will be used to merge
the result.</p></li>
<li><p>A dictionary of pairs (name, value) with the parameters described in
the previous element.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>an d returns a result Pandas data frame. This frame <strong>must</strong> have one
column with the key column name provided so that it can be properly
merged with the existing data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a transformation does not comply with these properties the system administrator will see a summary of these checks to diagnose the problem.</p>
